# Sean's Dotfiles
Repository of the dotfiles I use on my own system, along with setup scripts to reduce headache on system re-installations

## Making and restoring backups
The `backup.sh` script can be used to make or restore backups of a given group of dotfiles.
The script takes the following arguments:
    - Action: Required, type of action to perform (`-r` for a restoration or `-b` for a backup)
    - Category: Optional, which category of dotfiles to backup. Default is all, supported categories are as follows:
        - zsh
        - vim
        - tmux
        - git
        - powerline
Valid use of the script looks like this:
```bash
backup.sh -b zsh
```
